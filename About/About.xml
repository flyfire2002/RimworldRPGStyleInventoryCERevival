    This is the revival of a fork of RPG Style Inventory made for Combat Extended.
    Credit goes to the author of RPG Style Inventory, Combat Extended, and the original author of RPG Style Inventory CE.
    This project wouldn't exist if not for their fantastic work.
    If you like it, go to the original mod page and leave an upvote.

    I will maintain this fork until original mod is otherwise made compatible with combat extended.

    (Since this is a fork of RPG style inventory, you don't need the original mod)
